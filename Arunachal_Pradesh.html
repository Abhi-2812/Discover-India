                    <p>Arunachal Pradesh is a state in Northeast India. It was formed from the erstwhile North-East
                        Frontier Agency (NEFA) region,
                        and became a state on 20 February 1987. It borders the states of Assam and Nagaland to the
                        south. It shares international borders with Bhutan in the west, Myanmar in the east, and a
                        disputed border with China in the north at the McMahon Line. Itanagar is the state capital of
                        Arunachal Pradesh. Arunachal Pradesh is the largest of the Seven Sister States of Northeast
                        India by area. Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,129 km border with China's Tibet Autonomous
                        Region.

                        As of the 2011 Census of India, Arunachal Pradesh has a population of 1,382,611 and an area of
                        83,743 square kilometres (32,333 sq mi). It is an ethnically diverse state, with predominantly
                        Monpa people in the west, Tani people in the center, Mishmi and Tai people in the east, and Naga
                        people in the southeast of the state. About 45 tribes/sub-tribes live in the state. The main
                        tribe of the state is Adi, Nyshi, Galo, Tagin, Apatani, and so forth. The Mishmi tribe has three
                        sub-tribes, namely Idu-Mishmi, Digaru-Mishmi and Miju-Mishmi.

                        A major part of the state is claimed by both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of
                        China as part of the region of South Tibet. During the 1962 Sino-Indian War,
                        most of Arunachal Pradesh was captured and temporarily controlled by the Chinese People's
                        Liberation Army.</p>

                    <div class="title">Culture</div>
                    <p> The culture of Arunachal Pradesh is truly varied in the sense that the state has 26 major tribes
                        including sub-tribes. Every tribe has their own unique set of traditions and customs. The major
                        tribes of Arunachal are: Adi, Galo, Aka, Apatani, Nyishi, Tagins, Bori, and Bokar etc.
                        The sun and the moon are the presiding deities of the major tribes who follow the Donyi-Polo
                        religion (the name stands for sun and moon). The West Kameng and Tawang district are mainly
                        inhabited by the Tibetan-influenced Monpa and Sherdukpen tribe. In Lohit district it is the
                        Khampti and the Singpho tribe. All these four major tribes are followers of two different sects
                        of Buddhism (Mahayana Hinayana). The other tribes are basically followers of ancient beliefs
                        with animal worship being quite prominent amongst them.
                        Arunachal’s cultural lifestyle is dominated by colourful festivals. Since agriculture is the
                        mainstay here so people generally celebrate festivals as a mark of thanksgiving to the Almighty
                        for giving them a good harvest. These festivals also showcase the artistic skills of the various
                        tribes. To experience the cultural festivals of the state, one should visit Ziro district which
                        is very popular for festivities.

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>Arunachal Pradesh is an ancient land of legend and antiquity. The widely scattered ruins in the
                        state bear testimony to the fact that once upon a time a rich culture flourished in this region.
                        Arunachal Pradesh is mentioned in Kalki Purana and Mahabharata. It is a place called Prabhu
                        Parvat described in Puranas. Parashurama had atoned for his sins here, Rishi Vyas worshiped
                        here, King Bhishmak established his kingdom here and Lord Krishna married Rukmini.

                        Archaeological remains spread in different parts of Arunachal Pradesh show that it has a rich
                        cultural tradition. The first ancestor of the tribal groups migrated from Tibet and was joined
                        by Thai-Burmese counterparts later. Except for the north-western parts of the state, little is
                        known about the history of Arunachal Pradesh, although the Adi tribe had legendary knowledge of
                        the history.
                        The earliest references of Arunachal are found in the era of Mahabharta, Ramayana and other
                        Vedic legends. Several characters, such as king Bhismaka, were referred to as people from the
                        region in the Mahabharata epic. The archaeological remains at Bhishmak Nagar, the pilgrimage
                        site at Brahmakund in Lohit and the ruins of Bhalnkpang fort in Kameng relate back to Puranic
                        legend.
                        Arunachal Pradesh attained full state status on 20 February 1987. Till 1972 it was known as
                        North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). It received Union Territory status from 20 January 1972. On
                        15 August 1975, the elected Legislative Assembly was formed and the first Council of Ministers
                        took over. The first general elections were held in February 1978.</p>
