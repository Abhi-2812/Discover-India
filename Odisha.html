                    <p>Odisha is a confluence of the Aryan, Dravidian and Adivasi cultures. Most festivals in the state
                        bring out some part of these cultures and celebrate their religion by way of festivals which
                        span out the entire year. ... Chaitra Parva, a festival of Chhou dance, is celebrated at
                        Baripada.

                    <p>Odisha has a rich religious and cultural heritage that goes back more than two thousand years.
                        The state is full of historical places to visit and has many heritage monuments that reflect its
                        history and culture. Home to Hindus, Jains and Buddhists, Odisha offers historic sites and
                        tourist attractions that will leave you spellbound. There are many historical monuments in
                        Odisha, scattered all over the state. Thanks to these sites, no one leaves Odisha dissatisfied.
                        If you are interested in heritage tourism, you will definitely not want to miss the top
                        historical places in Odisha. In fact, you will even find some UNESCO World Heritage Sites in
                        Odisha. Bhubaneswar, the capital city of Odisha, is a place every tourist must visit; indeed no
                        Odisha heritage tour is complete without it. The city is home to around 500 temples, because of
                        which it has been nicknamed the Temple City of India. The Lingaraj Temple, dedicated to Lord
                        Shiva, is a major draw both for devotees who journey here every year in the thousands and for
                        tourists who want to stand in the shadows of a monument that is a window into the history. The
                        strong Buddhist influence in the state can be seen in the Shanti Stupa, a joint Indo-Japanese
                        construction.</p>

                    <p>In its long history, Odisha has had a continuous tradition of dharmic religions especially
                        Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Ashoka's conquest of Kalinga (India) made Buddhism a principal
                        religion in the state which led to the establishment of numerous Stupas and Buddhist learning
                        centres

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>Human history in Odisha begins in the Lower Paleolithic era, as Acheulian tools dating to the
                        period have been discovered in various places in the region.[1] The early history of Odisha can
                        be traced back to the mentions found in ancient texts like the Mahabharata, Maha Govinda Sutta
                        and some Puranas.The region was also known to other kingdoms in region of East Indies due to
                        maritime trade relations.</p>
