                    <p>Karnataka is a state in the
                        south western region of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States
                        Reorganisation Act. Originally known as the State of Mysore , it was renamed Karnataka
                        in 1973. The state corresponds to the Carnatic region. Its capital and largest city is
                        Bangalore.

                        Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the
                        north, Telangana to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and
                        Kerala to the southwest. It is the only southern state to have land borders with all of the
                        other 4 southern Indian sister states. The state covers an area of 191,791 square kilometres
                        (74,051 sq mi), or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the sixth
                        largest Indian state by area. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is
                        the eighth largest state by population, comprising 31 districts. Kannada, one of the classical
                        languages of India, is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other minority
                        languages spoken include Urdu, Konkani, Marathi, Tulu, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kodava and
                        Beary. Karnataka also contains some of the only villages in India where Sanskrit is primarily
                        spoken.</p>

                        music, sophisticated heritage, zealous festivities, elegant clothing and delectable cuisine
                        Karnataka has a plethora of historical secrets, interwoven within a rich and varied culture. It
                        is a major tourist attraction with cities like Bangalore, the scenic Coorg, the lesser known
                        hill town of Chikmagalur, and heritage sites like Hampi, which attract countless people every
                        year. Karnataka offers a little something for everyone, be it a history enthusiast, a nature
                        lover, or someone looking to immerse oneself in its cultural heritage. It is home to various

                        the Kodava community and others, who contribute to its own unique culture.
                        Karnataka is home to 50 different tribes, each having their traditions and customs. Tribal art
                        is another indigenous art form. Hase Chitra mud painting is an art form emerging from the

                    <p>Once home to the Vijayanagara Empire and four different dynasties that lasted for 300 years,
                        Hampi now is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The ruins of the Empire can be found in the form of
                        temples, architectural marvels, the famous musical pillars, royal enclosures and scattered
                        monuments. Hampi, housing these ancient ruins doesn't fail to attract abundant tourists every
                        year. The Hazara Ram temple is a major attraction as it is believed to be there since Ram and
                        Krishna's era. The rich history of Hampi is also displayed in the Archaeological Museum located
                        in the town. Another popular attraction is the Mysore Palace. The architectural marvel is a
                        combination of Indo-Saracenic style. </p>

                    <p>Considered a difficult art form, Yakshagana lacks a written script and depends entirely on the
                        artist's ability to be spontaneous, to improvise, to be a good orator and have a sound knowledge
                        of the plot and character. The unique art form of Yakshagana has various elements like dance
                        (Nrithya), makeup (Bannagarike or Mukhavarnike), background singing and direction (Bhagvathike),
                        two forms of drums (Chande Maddale) and conversation (Arthagarike). The art form is 500 years
                        old, and the entire portrayal takes place in refined Kannada, without even a word of any other
                        language. It is an important tradition and also a prevalent art form.

                        Siddi community's Dammami dance is also another traditional dance form. This dance form derives
                        its name from an instrument Damam, made from leather. Initially, the dance was performed by
                        Siddis post hunting to honour the tribal God Siddhinas. However, as the activity itself is
                        banned, the dance is now performed once a year for the whole night. The performances are done in
                        the Konkani language and depict a story, usually about the hunt or farming activities like
                        ploughing, harvesting, etc.</p>

                    <p>Karnataka has an enthralling history. This state lying in the southern part of India has been
                        under the rule of several dynasties that have shaped its history. It has been invaded by a
                        number of rulers at different points of time in history. Due to the influence of various rulers
                        and dynasties Karnataka became enriched with their distinctive culture and values.

                        In the ancient times Karnataka was known as Karunadu which means elevated land or high plateau.
                        The history of Karnataka can be traced back to the prehistoric days.
                        The Early History states that Karnataka went through the hands of many dynasties like the Maurya
                        Empire, Satavahana Dynasty, the Kadamba dynasty, and the Western Ganga Dynasty. During the
                        medieval period the Chalukyas, Rasthtrakutas, Hoysala, and Vijayanagara Empires ruled this
                        state. The modern era in history witnessed the rule of the Wodeyars of Mysore, Hyder Ali and
                        Tipu Sultan followed by the British in this state. After India gained Independence from the
