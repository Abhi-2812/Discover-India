                        populated state in the country.

                        The state was formed by the partition of ten Chhattisgarhi and six Gondi-speaking districts in
                        the southeast of Madhya Pradesh.Its capital city is Raipur. It borders 7 states – Uttar
                        Pradesh to the north, Madhya Pradesh to the northwest, Maharashtra to the southwest, Jharkhand
                        to the northeast, Odisha to the east, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to the south. Currently,
                        it comprises 32 districts.

                        Chhattisgarh is one of the fastest-developing states in India. Its Gross State Domestic
                        Product (GSDP) is ₹3.63 lakh crore (US$48 billion), with a per capita GSDP of ₹102,762
                        (US$1,400). A resource-rich state, Chhattisgarh provides electricity, coal, and steel to the

                    <div class="title">Culture</div>
                    <p>The cultural life of Chhattisgarh is a mixture of various forms of tribal dances, folk songs,
                        traditional art and crafts, regional festivals, and fairs. The tribal people preserve their rich
                        culture modestly and religiously. People of Chhattisgarh are simple and they follow their
                        traditional customs and beliefs.



                        Chhattisgarh has been home to many tribals. Even this state has been home to the oldest tribal
                        community of India and it is believed that the ancient tribals were living in Bastar for more
                        than 10000 years. Later, after some time, the Aryans took possession of the Indian mainland.

                    <p>Chhattisgarh , India’s 10th largest state is endowed with a rich culture, heritage and attractive
                        natural diversity. Situated in the heart of India with a ten thousand years old civilisation it
                        is a land ‘Full of Surprises’ that attracts tourists who look forward to experience the
                        pristine. Chhattisgarh is an uniquely Indian experience. Home to the country’s widest
                        waterfalls, caves, lush green forests, ancient monuments, rare wild life, exquisitely curved
                        temples, Buddhist sites and hill plateaus. Chhattisgarh boasts of more than 80% of bio diversity
                        that is not found anywhere across the country. The state has 44% of forest cover with 32% of
                        tribal population. Chhattisgarh has become a magnet of nature enthusiasts who wish to explore
                        unique tribal arts, crafts and traditions. For centuries its tribal communities have played a
                        pivotal role in nurturing and protecting the natural habitat through the eco-friendly
                        practices.Chhattisgarh offers everything to a traveller - art and architecture, heritage,
                        handicrafts, cuisine, fairs and festivals. Chhattisgarh figures in numerous tales that form part
                        of the two great Indian epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The state boasts of the widest
                        waterfall in India, Chitrakote. In monsoon when the Indravati River is in full flow, this
                        waterfall in Bastar District becomes almost 980 ft wide!!! Chhattisgarh has a legacy of gods and
                        goddesses and numerous temples, both ancient and modern which attracts devotees, pilgrims and
                        travellers throughout the year. The annual mega event ‘Sirpur International Dance and Music
                        Festival’ which is held every year at the Buddhist site of Sirpur is particularly note worthy.
                        This state presents a curious mixture of modern and traditional way of life. </p>

                    <div class="title">Tradition</div>
                    <p>The tribal culture in Chhattisgarh dates back several millennia, and traditional music, dance,
                        handicrafts and customs remain largely unchanged, given the region sees relatively few visitors
                        and little in the way of development. Tribal tourism in Chhattisgarh is therefore not only an
                        opportunity to be immersed in the state’s unique cultural heritage, but also to contribute
                        towards its preservation.
                        The tribes of Chhattisgarh are well known for their handicrafts, which have international renown
                        and provide a valuable source of income. In the markets you’ll likely see intricate wood
                        carvings, metalwork, terracotta sculptures and vessels, jewellery and garments weaved on
                        handlooms from Kosa silk, obtained from Indian silk worms. On some cultural holidays in
                        Chhattisgarh you may be able to see craftspeople at work in their workshops, </p>

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>Chhattisgarh was carved out from Madhya Pradesh on 1st November 2000 by including 16
                        Chhattisgarhi speaking southeastern districts. It got its name from the 36 ancient forts in the
                        area which are Ratanpur, Vijaypur, Kharound, Maro, Kautgarh, Nawagarh, Sondhi, Aukhar,
                        Padarbhatta, Semriya, Champa, Lafa, Chhuri, Kenda, Matin, Aparora, Pendra, Kurkuti-kandri,
                        Raipur, Patan, Simaga, Singarpur, Lavan, Omera, Durg, Saradha, Sirasa, Menhadi, Khallari,
                        Sirpur, Figeswar, Rajim, Singhangarh, Suvarmar, Tenganagarh, and Akaltara. However, some believe
                        that the name Chhattisgarh is the corrupted form of Chedisgarh which literally means Raj or
                        “Empire of the chedis“.
                        From 1741 to 1845, Chhattisgarh was under the control of the Maratha Empire. From 1845 to 1947,
                        the British had control over Chhattisgarh. With the arrival of the British in 1845, Raipur
                        gained prominence at the place of Ratanpur. In 1905 Sambalpur district was shifted to Odisha and
                        Surguja State was shifted from Bengal to Chhattisgarh. When the State Reorganization Commission
                        was set up in 1954, the demand for an independent Chhattisgarh state was brought to the fore,
                        but the matter was still not approved. In 1955, there was a demand for an independent state in
                        the Nagpur assembly, which at that time was in central India.
                        On 25 August 2000, the President of India also gave his consent under the Madhya Pradesh
                        Reorganization Act 2000. On 1 November 2000, the Government of India divided the state of Madhya
                        Pradesh into two states called Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.</p>
