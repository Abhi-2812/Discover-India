                        it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the Great Indian
                        Desert) and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to
                        the west, along the Sutlej-Indus River valley. It is bordered by five other Indian states:
                        Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the
                        southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. Its geographical location is 23.3 to 30.12 North

                    <p>The Ghoomar dance from Jodhpur and Kalbeliya dance of Jaisalmer have gained international
                        recognition. Folk music is a vital part of Rajasthani culture. Bhopa, Chang, Teratali, Ghindar,
                        Kachchigghori, Tejaji, parth dance etc. are the examples of the traditional Rajasthani culture.
                        Folk songs are commonly ballads which relate heroic deeds and love stories; and religious or
                        devotional songs known as bhajans and banis (often accompanied by musical instruments like
                        dholak, sitar, sarangi etc.) are also sung

                    <p>Rajasthan has cultural traditions that reflect the ancient Indian way of life. Rajasthani society
                        is a blend of predominantly Hindus with sizable minorities of Muslims and Jains. Jats are mostly
                        Hindus and Sikhs. Meenas of Rajasthan to date strongly follow Vedic culture which usually
                        includes worship of Bhainroon (Shiva) and Krishna as well as the Durga.

                        years ago. This region was inhabited during great floods after the ice age as well. This area
                        was known as Matsya kingdom. It was the site of the Indus Valley Civilization.</p>
