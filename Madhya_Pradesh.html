                    <p>Although the modern state of Madhya Pradesh came into being in 1956, its cultural heritage is
                        ancient and chequered. Innumerable monuments, exquisitely carved temples, stupas, forts and
                        palaces on hilltops, raise in the visitors mind visions of empires and kingdoms, of the great
                        warriors and builders, poets and musicians, saints and philosophers; of Hinduism, Buddhism, and
                        Jainism. The famous Sanskrit poet-dramatist Kalidasa and the great musician of the Mughal court,
                        Tansen, were from Madhya Pradesh. They are known all over the world.

                        Three sites in Madhya Pradesh have been declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:

                        The Khajuraho Group of Monuments (1986)
                        Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi (1989)
                        The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka (2003)
                        The city of Gwalior and Orccha(2020) ( Not included as[2] a world heritage site, pilot cities
                        for the Historic Urban Landscape programme and survey )</p>

                    <p>Madhya Pradesh is in the center of the Indian subcontinent and is known for its breathtaking
                        natural beauty with much architectural evidence and as people of Madhya Pradesh there dressing
                        is also diverse. The main reason for the diversity in clothing is the various textile techniques
                        used.

                        The main clothing of women in Madhya Pradesh is ghagra choli where ghagra is a long skirt while
                        choli is its top blouse worn with varied styles of odhni or dupatta. Batik, tie, and dye are the
                        main patterns of printing used on their traditional dresses. Ornaments play a major role in the
                        dress of tribal women.

                        Men in Madhya Pradesh wear traditional dhoti with a headgear known as Safa or Pagadi like many
                        other Indian states. Men also wear Mirzai a jacket of black or white color. The costume of urban
                        Madhya Pradesh is similar to other parts of India, women usually wear saree or salwar suits and
                        men can be seen wearing shirts and pants.</p>

                    <p>Madhya Pradesh, as a state came into being way back in 1956 and a new state of Chattisgarh carved
                        out of it, came into existence in the year 2000. Madhya Pradesh, as is understandable from its
                        name itself, enjoys a central location.

                        Madhya Pradesh’s history dates back to the prehistoric age. The United Nations Educational,
                        Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has declared three locations in the state as
                        heritage sites: Temples at Khajuraho, Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi, and Rock Shelters of
                        Bhimbetka.
                        The southern part of Madhya Pradesh like Malwa was invaded many times by the South Indian
                        Western Chalukya Empire, which imposed a lot of rules on the Parmar kingdom of Malwa. Northern
                        Madhya Pradesh was captured by the Turkish Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century. Towards the end
                        of the 14th century, with the end of the Delhi Sultanate, an independent religious empire was
                        discovered, including the Tomar Empire of Gwalior and the Muslim Sultanate of Malwa. In 1531,
                        the Gujarat Sultanate annexed the Malwa Sultanate. Most of the state came under the control of
                        Sher Shah Suri in 1540 and was later captured by the Hindu Raj Hemu.
                        After India’s independence, the state of Madhya Pradesh was established on 1 November 1956 by
                        merging the erstwhile British Central Provinces and the provincial states of Berar and Makri and
                        Chhattisgarh, at which time its capital was Nagpur.

                        The states of Central India, Vindhya Pradesh, and Bhopal were established from the Central
                        Indian Agency. In 1956, Central India, Vindhya Pradesh, and Bhopal were merged into the state of
                        Madhya Pradesh and Nagpur was added to the Marathi-speaking southern region of Vidarbha and
                        incorporated into the Bombay state. First Jabalpur was made the capital of the state, but due to
                        political pressure at the last minute, Bhopal was made the state capital. In November 2000, the
                        state of Chhattisgarh was divided by dividing the south-eastern part of the state under the
                        Madhya Pradesh Reorganization Act. </p>
