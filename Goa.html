                    <p>Goa is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the
                        Konkan region, geographically separated from the Deccan highlands by the Western Ghats. It
                        is located between the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the east and
                        south, with the Arabian Sea forming its western coast. It is India's smallest state by area and
                        its fourth-smallest by population. Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all Indian
                        states, two and a half times as high as the GDP per capita of the country as a whole.
                        Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year because of its
                        white-sand beaches, active nightlife, places of worship, and World Heritage-listed architecture.
                        It also has rich flora and fauna because it lies very close to the North Western Ghats
                        rainforests, one of the rare biodiversity hotspots of the world.</p>

                    <p>A small state on India's western coast, Goa has always benefitted as a trade centre because of
                        its easily accessible ports. With a beautiful harmonization of the East and West, Goans have
                        taken the best of both worlds. A civilization of warm, happy people, Goa sees a mix of different
                        religions like Christians, Catholics, Muslims, and Hindus that live together in harmony.
                        Following their age-old traditions and customs, Goan's celebrate all major festivals with
                        fervour without bringing any religious barriers within the society.
                        With a strong influence from the west, Goa has always had a more contemporary mindset. Their
                        rich heritage culture has not been tarnished by the rapid industrialization that has become
                        commonplace in the rest of India yet. Celebrating livelihood and religious festivals with
                        scrumptious food and delightful music, the locals are humble, warm and fun-loving individuals.
                        In an area where tourism is the core economy booster, small handicrafts and souvenir jewellery
                        are popular items found in the local markets. Skilled artisans reuse shells and coconut skins
                        found on the beach to make stunning jewellery, frames, and showpieces for home decor. Apart from
                        this, bamboo, brass, and silver are also widely sold in the form of jewellery and artefacts that
                        attract tourists from across the globe.

                    <p>Goaâ€™s past as a Portuguese colony has lent it a unique architectural style and ethos. While early
                        morning walks around Old Goa are not to be missed, Fontainhas, Fort Aguada, Chandor as well as a
                        number of museums are a must-do as well. If learning more of Goa's fascinating history is on
                        your mind, we recommend heading to these places to discover its rich heritage. Grab a camera,
                        carry a diary and you will have an unforgettable lesson in Goa's heritage.
                        Known for its spritzing beaches and might-boggling nightlife, there are also numerous historical
                        places in Goa wrapped in its time-worn monuments and tropical spices of Southern and Portuguese
                        Cuisines. The prepossessing face which it has today is a result of what it has gone through in
                        its bygone days. With its authentic ancient touch and great pace of modernization, Goa is
                        capable of attracting millions of tourists every year.</p>

                    <p>The tradition of Goa is rich and possesses a unique legacy of different cultures. In Goa,
                        tradition and customs have affected almost every aspect of its lifestyle. One can see the
                        typical Portugal custom of constructing a house. Churches are in traditional Portugal style.
                        People are free to practice the religion of their choice and they respect the existence of other
                        religions too. At the same time, they move ahead with the world and are in sync with the latest
                        trends and beliefs.
                        The traditions and customs of Goa have allowed secularism to flourish and have made people more
                        tolerant towards other religious practices. It is not uncommon to see people from another
                        religion going to a church or a temple or a mosque. They follow the tradition of their choice
                        and at the same time respect other customs. This is what makes Goans stand out in a striking
                        contrast to the rest of India. The Goan tradition and customs have truly given a unique identity
                        to the state and made it a role model for others to follow.
                        The culture of Goa is an amalgamation of Indian and Portuguese culture. The long Portuguese rule
                        has influenced the culture in more ways than one and many of the Portuguese traditions are
                        reflected in the Goan culture even today.</p>

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>History : According to Ancient Indian Mythology is said that Goa was reclaimed from the sea. It
                        is believed that Sixth Avatar of Vishnu Sage, Parshuram created the Sahyadri range and struck an
                        arrow into the western seas. The arrow is said to have sent the seas rolling back to create
                        Gomantak or Goa.

                        It is believed that Aryan migrated to Goa around 2400 BC. Original tribals migrated in hills due
                        to Aryan arrival in this part. It is believed that Sumerian civilization was existed dating back
                        2000 BC. These people introduced their ideas of all types with the result that the ownership of
                        the land vested in the main village diety. The co-operative farming turned into common
                        holdership or villages who were considered to be founders of the village commune and its
                        administration took a form of oligarchic democrocy. The Aryans of the first wave accepted this
                        type of administration and improved upon it.

                        Mainly Aryans consisted of Bhojas, Chediyas, Kshatriyas and Brahmins were arrived in Goa. Bhojas
                        ruled over Goa from aobout 4th century AD to 6th century AD. It is believed that Brahmins were
                        migrated to Goa by Parashurama from Kasmir and the banks of the river Sarawati. Kadambas also
                        ruled over Goa, they were originally from Karnataka. They ruled from Chandrapura modern Chnador
                        on the banks of the river Khushavati. Rulers from Vijayanagar Empure also ruled over Goa. Muslim
                        rulers also ruled over Goa. It has also impact on the life of the people. Muslim art and
                        architecutre can be seen in buidlings and mosques in Goa.

                        Goa was under Protuguese rule for about 450 years. Afonso de Albuqureque, first portuguese
                        attacked Goa and occupied it. Due to Portuguese rule over Goa, here Christian religion spread
                        very fast.

                        In Goa Hindu, Muslim, Christian religions are found. </p>
