                    <p>Andhra Pradesh is a state in the south-eastern coastal region of India. It is the
                        seventh-largest state by area covering an area of 162,975 km2 (62,925 sq mi) and tenth-most
                        populous state with 49,386,799 inhabitants, with the state capital being Amaravati.
                        It is bordered by Telangana to the north-west, Chhattisgarh to the north, Odisha to the
                        north-east, Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the west and the Bay of Bengal to the
                        east. It has the second longest coastline in India after Gujarat, of about 974 km (605
                        mi). Andhra State was the first state to be formed on a linguistic basis in India on 1
                        October 1953. On 1 November 1956, Andhra State was merged with the Telugu-speaking areas of
                        the Hyderabad State to form Andhra Pradesh. The state was then reorganised in June 2014 to form
                        a separate Telangana state.</p>

                    <p>The Andhras’ contribution to India’s cultural heritage is substantial. Architecture and painting
                        have been highly developed arts in the region since ancient times. The kuchipudi style of dance
                        is unique in the Indian tradition, while Karnatak (South Indian) music has derived much from
                        Andhra roots. Many of southern India’s major composers of classical Indian music have been
                        Andhras, and Telugu has been the language of most of the compositions. Telugu, one of the four
                        literary languages of the Dravidian family, occupies a prestigious place among Indian languages,
                        being renowned for its antiquity and admired by many for its mellifluous quality. Telugu
                        literature was prominent in the Indian literary renaissance of the 19th and 20th centuries, as
                        the writing resonated with a revolution in literary forms and expression, stimulated to a large
                        degree by Western genres. Andhra Pradesh has many periodicals in English, Telugu, and Urdu.
                        Muslim culture in the Telangana region further enriches the state’s cultural diversity.

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>After being ruled by many invaders for centuries, Telugu people's capital Andhra's foundation was
                        laid in the struggle of India's independence under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi which was
                        part of Madras Presidency then. However, post-independence, with great leader Potti Sriramulu's
                        sacrifice and the campaigns of Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu and Kandukuri Veresalingam's social
                        reforms movements, the Andhra region finally got separated from the Madras Presidency and turned
                        into a first linguistic state having its capital at Kurnool.
                        The credit goes to great leader Potti Sriramulu who went for the hunger strike and made his
                        voice reach to Delhi with his great sacrifice. He fought for the separate Andhra state for 56
                        days and breathed his last in the process, which has led to riots in the state leaving the then
                        Prime minister with no option other than the formation of Andhra state on October 1, 1953. He is
                        regarded as immortal being for his contribution in the liberation of Andhra state from Tamil
                        Nadu state.
                        After a wide range of consultations from Indian leaders to which Nizams had not obliged, the
                        Indian government has forced it to merge in
                        India thus forming Hyderabad state (which is now Telangana). Later, the Government of India has
                        merged Hyderabad with Andhra on the proposal of Andhra leaders making a way for Andhra Pradesh
                        state as part of the linguistic state on November 1, 1956. Since then the Andhra Pradesh state
                        has been celebrating the state formation day on November 1.
