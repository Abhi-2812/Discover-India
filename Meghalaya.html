                    <p>Meghalaya meaning "abode of clouds"; from Sanskrit megha,
                        "cloud" + ƒÅ-laya, "abode") is a state in northeastern India. Meghalaya was formed by carving out
                        two districts from the state of Assam: the United Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills, and the Garo
                        Hills on 21 January 1972.Meghalaya was previously part of Assam, but on 21 January 1972, the
                        districts of Khasi, Garo and Jaintia Hills became the new state of Meghalaya. The population of
                        Meghalaya as of 2016 is estimated to be 3,211,474.[9] Meghalaya covers an area of approximately
                        22,430 square kilometres, with a length-to-breadth ratio of about 3:1.</p>

                    <p>Meghalaya's main ethnic communities, each having its own distinctive customs and cultural
                        traditions are the Khasis (of Mon-Khmer ancestry), the Garos (of Tibeto-Burman origin) and the
                        Jaintias said to be from South East Asia. The common trait binding all three communities is its
                        matrilineal system in which the family linage is taken from the mother's side. The people of
                        Meghalaya are known to be hospitable, cheerful and friendly.</p>

                        Meghalaya lies in the extreme northeastern region of India. It is the only state in the entire
                        northeast which is matrilineal and takes the identity solely from the mother. Meghalayan women
                        are very lucky in this way, because they are treated with equal rights but the head of the
                        family is always Father. The occurrence of illegitimate child or child abandoning in this
                        society is rare except for a few stray cases. Off springs whether male or female are treated
                        alike. On the whole, the society is unique, devoid of complexes and the much feared and dreaded
                        bride burning or Dowry system.

                        In this matrilineal society, lets take the Khasis for example, the blood relations on the
                        mother's side are known as the "Cognates" (Ki Kur) and "Agnates" (Ki Kha) refer to the paternal
                        side. The cognates trace their origin from a common ancestress and their lineal descent is from
                        mother to daughter, just the opposite from other societies.</p>

                    <p>Jainsem is the traditional wear of Khasi women. It is a single piece of cloth wrapped in a
                        criss-cross manner across the shoulders and it is paired with a blouse. Dakmanda is a short
                        piece of unstitched cotton cloth worn around the waist by the Garo women. Jaintia women wear
                        blouses paired with sarong which is known as Thoh Khyrwang.

                        The traditional wear of the men includes a headgear or turban and a dhoti which is stitched.

                    <p>Meghalaya, alongside neighbouring Indian states, has been of archaeological interest. People have
                        lived in Meghalaya since the Neolithic. Neolithic sites discovered so far are located in areas
                        of high elevation in Khasi Hills, Garo Hills and in neighbouring states, where Neolithic style
                        jhum or shifting cultivation is practiced even today. The highland plateaus fed by abundant
                        rains provided safety from floods and a rich soil. The importance of Meghalaya is its
                        possible role in human history via domestication of rice. One of the competing theories for the
                        origin of rice comes from Ian Glover, who states, "India is the center of greatest diversity of
                        domesticated rice with over 20,000 identified species and Northeast India is the most favorable
                        single area of the origin of domesticated rice."[20] The limited archaeology done in the hills
                        of Meghalaya suggest human settlement since ancient times.</p>
