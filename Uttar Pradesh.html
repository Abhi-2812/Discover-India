                    <p>Uttar Pradesh is a state in northern India. With over 200 million inhabitants, it is the
                        most populated state in India as well as the most populous country subdivision in the world.[12]
                        It was established in 1950 after India had become a republic. It was a successor to the United
                        Provinces (UP) during the period of the Dominion of India (1947â€“1950), which in turn was a
                        successor to the United Provinces (UP) established in 1935, and eventually of the United
                        Provinces of Agra and Oudh established in 1902 during the British Raj. The state is divided into
                        18 divisions and 75 districts, with the state capital being Lucknow, and Allahabad serving as
                        the judicial capital. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand), was
                        created from Uttar Pradesh's western Himalayan hill region. The two major rivers of the state,
                        the Ganges and its tributary Yamuna, meet at the Triveni Sangam in Allahabad, a Hindu pilgrimage
                        site. Other notable rivers are Gomti and Saryu. The forest cover in the state is 6.1% of the
                        state's geographical area. The cultivable area is 82% of total geographical area and net area
                        sown is 68.5% of cultivable area.</p>

                    <p>The Culture of Uttar Pradesh is an Indian culture which has its roots in Hindi and Urdu
                        literature, music, fine arts, drama and cinema. Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, has
                        historical monuments including Bara Imambara and Chhota Imambara, and has preserved the damaged
                        complex of the Oudh-period British Resident's quarters, which are being restored

                    <p>Uttar Pradesh is known for its rich culture and tradition. It is home to Ayodhya and Mathura
                        birthplace of Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and Bhgwan Parshuram respectively. Uttar Pradesh attracts
                        many national and international tourists.</p>

                    <p>Uttar Pradesh is mostly a state of two sects- Hindus and Muslims. The traditional dress of the
                        women of Uttar Pradesh is a sari and a blouse or salwar kameez. The men opt for dhoti kurta or
                        kurta pyjama. They also wear pagri or topi on their heads

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>The history of Uttar Pradesh the Northern Indian state, stretches back technically to its
                        formation on 1 April 1937 as the North-Western Provinces of Agra and Awadh, but the region
                        itself shows the presence of human habitation dating back to between 85,000 and 73,000 years
                        ago. The region seems to have been domesticated as early as 6,000 BC.

                        The early modern period in the region started in 1526 after Babur invaded the Delhi Sultanate,
                        and established the Mughal Empire covering large parts of modern Uttar Pradesh. The remnants of
                        the Mughal Empire include their monuments, most notably Fatehpur Sikri, Allahabad Fort, Agra
                        Fort, and the Taj Mahal.</p>
