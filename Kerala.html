                    <p>Kerala, southwestern coastal state of India. It is a small state, constituting only about 1
                        percent of the total area of the country. Kerala stretches for about 360 miles (580 km) along
                        the Malabar Coast, varying in width from roughly 20 to 75 miles (30 to 120 km). It is bordered
                        by the states of Karnataka (formerly Mysore) to the north and Tamil Nadu to the east and by the
                        Arabian Sea to the south and west; it also surrounds Mahe, a segment of the state of Puducherry,
                        on the northwestern coast. The capital is Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum).

                        Although isolated from the Indian interior by the mountainous belt of the Western Ghats, Kerala
                        has been exposed to many foreign influences via its long coastline; consequently, the state has
                        developed a unique culture within the subcontinent, not only with a diverse religious tradition
                        but also with its own language, Malayalam. Also notable is the high social status that continues
                        to be accorded to women of Kerala, owing to the former strength of a matrilineal kinship system.
                        Area 15,005 square miles (38,863 square km).

                    <div class="title">Culture</div>
                    <p>The cultural heritage of Kerala reflects extensive interaction with diverse communities from
                        antiquity to the present. With an array of ancient Hindu temples with copper-clad roofs, later
                        mosques with “Malabar gables” (triangular projections at the rooftops), and Baroque churches
                        from the Portuguese colonial era, the state’s architecture offers a chronicle of the social,
                        spiritual, and political history of the area. Other characteristically Keralan art forms include
                        intricate paintings on wood, thematic murals, and a remarkable variety of indoor and outdoor
                        lamps (from which the state has earned the sobriquet “Land of Lamps”).
                        Most traditional dances of Kerala pertain to the great Indian epics—the Mahabharata and the
                        Ramayana—or to the honouring of specific Hindu deities. In kathakali, the classical martial
                        dance-drama of Kerala, male performers portray both male and female characters. By contrast, the
                        bharata natyam dancing, dating to early Tamil times, is practiced exclusively by females.</p>

                    <div class="title">Heritage</div>
                    <p>The culture and heritage of Kerala is one that everyone must experience. The culture of Kerala is
                        a combination of both Indian and Dravidian culture. Now days this culture is being influenced by
                        the neighboring states as well. The main USP of Kerala is its performing arts like Kathakali,
                        Mohiniyattam and Martial Art of Kalaripayattu. As for the heritage of Kerala, it can be said
                        that this heritage holds a special and important place in the Indian history. Providing a
                        national integrity is the Kerala Heritage.

                        kathakaliThis culture and heritage of Kerala is reflected in its various art forms, martial
                        arts, dresses, the people and cuisine. When in Kerala do not miss a cultural art performance.
                        The visitors can enjoy the following art performances in Kerala.

                        Kathakali – A 300 year old dance that combines opera, ballet, masque and pantomime.

                        Mohiniyattam – The dance of a beautiful enchantress

                        Kalaripayattu – a martial art form that involves synchronizing the mind and body

                        Each of the festival in Kerala is celebrated with all its pomp and grandeur. The main festivals
                        of Kerala include Onam, Vishu, Eid, Thrissur Pooram and many more. In some of these festivals
                        like Poora</p>
                </div>
                <div class="code text">
                    <div class="title">Tradition</div>
                    <p>Kerala also has several tribal and folk art forms. For example, Kummattikali is the famous
                        colorful mask-dance of South Malabar, performed during the festival of Onam. The Kannyar Kali
                        dances (also known as Desathukali) are fast-moving, militant dances attuned to rhythmic
                        devotional folk songs and asuravadyas. Also important are various performance genres that are
                        Islam- or Christianity-themed. These include oppana, which is widely popular among Keralite
                        Muslims and is native to Malabar. Oppana incorporates group dance accompanied by the beat of
                        rhythmic hand-clapping and Vishal vocalizations.

                        Margam Kali is one of the ancient round group dance of Kerala practiced by Saint Thomas
                        Christians.[11]

                        However, many of these native art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals and are
                        not as popular among ordinary Keralites. Thus, more contemporary forms — including those heavily
                        based on the use of often risqué and politically incorrect mimicry and parody — have gained
                        considerable mass appeal in recent years.</p>

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>Kerala is first mentioned (as Keralaputra) in a 3rd-century-BCE rock inscription left by the
                        Mauryan emperor Ashoka. In the last centuries BCE this region became famous among the Greeks and
                        Romans for its spices (especially pepper). During the first five centuries CE the region was a
                        part of Tamilakam—the territory of the Tamils—and thus was sometimes partially controlled by the
                        eastern Pandya and Chola dynasties, as well as by the Cheras. In the 1st century Jewish
                        immigrants arrived, and, according to local Christian tradition, St. Thomas the Apostle visited
                        Kerala in the same century (see St. Thomas [Mar Thoma] Christians).

                        Much of Kerala’s history from the 6th to the 8th century is obscure, but it is known that Arab
                        traders introduced Islam later in the period. Under the Kulashekhara dynasty (c. 800–1102),
                        Malayalam emerged as a distinct language, and Hinduism became prominent.

                        The Cholas often controlled Kerala during the 11th and 12th centuries. By the beginning of the
                        14th century, Ravi Varma Kulashekhara of the Venad kingdom established a short-lived supremacy
                        over southern India. After his death, Kerala became a conglomeration of warring chieftaincies,
                        among which the most important were Calicut (now Kozhikode) in the north and Venad in the south.

                        The era of foreign intervention began in 1498, when Vasco da Gama landed near Calicut. In the
                        16th century the Portuguese superseded the Arab traders and dominated the commerce of the
                        Malabar Coast. Their attempt to establish sovereignty was thwarted by the zamorin (hereditary
                        ruler) of Calicut. The Dutch ousted the Portuguese in the 17th century. Marthanda Varma ascended
                        the Venad throne in 1729 and crushed Dutch expansionist designs at the Battle of Kolachel 12
                        years later. Marthanda Varma then adopted a European mode of martial discipline and expanded the
                        Venad domain to encompass what became the southern state of Travancore. His alliance in 1757
                        with the raja of the central state of Cochin (Kochi), against the zamorin, enabled Cochin to
                        survive. By 1806, however, Cochin and Travancore, as well as the Malabar Coast in the north, had
                        become subject states under the British Madras Presidency.

                        Two years after India’s independence was achieved in 1947, Cochin and Travancore were united as
                        Travancore-Cochin state. The present state of Kerala was constituted on a linguistic basis in
                        1956 when the Malabar Coast and the Kasargod taluka (administrative subdivision) of South Kanara
                        were added to Travancore-Cochin.</p>
