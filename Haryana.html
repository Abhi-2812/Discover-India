                    <p>Haryana is one of the unique states in the country having developed culture and developing
                        economy. It's culture is deeply rooted in a pluralistic ethos of age -old histroy providing

                        cultural map of India. Haryana is proud of a rich cultural heritage that goes way back to the
                        Vedic times. The state is rich in folklore. The people of Haryana have their own traditions. The
                        age old customs of meditation, Yoga and chanting of Vedic Mantras, are still observed by the

                    <div class="title">Heritage</div>
                    <p>Haryana bears the footprints of kings and warriors, saint and sages, sufis and savants. The
                        continuity of its rich past has been unbroken through ages, with legends of the epic heroes and
                        places of pilgrimage like temples, sarovars and dargahs. The resilience of the spirit of its
                        people finds resurgence against a continuous back-drop of invasions and battles – triumphs and
                        conquests!

                        Being the gateway of North India, Haryana has witnessed many ancient to modern wars ranging from
                        Shuks and Huns to Akbar and Humayun and Babar's at Panipat to the decline of Mogul empire
                        leading to British rule.

                        Excavations of various archaeological sites like Nauragabad, Mittathal, Rakhi Garhi and several
                        others bear out evidence of pre-Harrappan and Harrappan culture. Findings of pottery, sculpture
                        and jewellery at Pehowa, Kurukshetra and Panipat sites match with Prithudaka (Pehowa), Tilpat
                        (Panipat) and Sonprastha (Sonipat), establish the to occurence of Mahabharata war.

                        Haryana Tourism has developed several heritage sites with ethnic grandeur and has created

                    <div class="title">Tradition</div>
                    <p>he tradition of Haryana gives equal social status, irrespective of their official or financial
                        positions in life, have equal social status, the only criterion of superiority is age. If two
                        Haryanavi sit on a bed the elder, even if he is a poor farmer, will sit towards the head of the
                        bed, and the younger, even if he is a very well to do, or is a senior civil or military officer,
                        will sit towards the foot of the bed. If men are sharing the same ‘hooka’ it is the duty of the
                        youngest to hold the ‘hooka’ and pass it around in turn to the others. The system is thus of a
                        very socialistic nature.

                        Love marriage is not accepted in Jat society which takes pride in following rigid customs so far
                        as relationships are concerned. In Haryanvi Jat society all have an equal status in spite of the
                        difference in financial conditions. The girl and boy from the same gotra do not enter into
                        marriage as per Vedic Aryans tradition followed by the Jats. They give preference to get wedded
                        in their own community. The groom and bride never come from the same village in a Haryanvi
                        Marriage. The remarriage of widows is an acceptable norm in the Jat community. The elders are
                        respected and all proposals are taken ahead only after their opinion is taken into
                        consideration.</p>

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>Haryana became a state of India on November 1, 1966, so 1st November is also known as Haryana
                        day. The present-day Haryana is the region where, along with the banks of the River Saraswati,
                        the Vedic Civilization began and matured. It was here that the Vedas were written, as the Aryans
                        chanted their sacred Mantras. Replete with myths and legends, Haryana’s 5000-year-old history is
                        steeped in glory. It was here that Lord Krishna preached Bhagavad-Gita at the start of the
                        battle of Mahabharat.Haryana has been the scene of many wars because of it being “The Gateway of
                        North India”. As years rolled by, successive streams of Huns, Turks, and the Afghans invaded
                        India and decisive battles were fought on this land. After the downfall of the Gupta empire in
                        the middle of the 6th century AD north India was again split into several kingdoms. The Huns
                        established their supremacy over Punjab. It was during this period that one of the greatest King
                        of ancient India, Harshvardhan began his rule.
                        Indian history is replete with tales of heroism of the highest order and in this context, the
                        historic significance of the battles of Panipat and Kurukshetra in Haryana cannot be ignored by
                        any means. The sacrifices of Haryana’s brave soldiers have played a very important role in
                        maintaining the territorial and sovereign integrity of our nation. The new state which emerged
                        as a separate political entity of the Indian Union on November 1, 1966, is considered to be the
                        cradle of rich Indian cultural heritage. In terms of economic development too, Haryana has come
                        a long way during the few past years.
