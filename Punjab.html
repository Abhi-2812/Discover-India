                    <p>Punjab is a state in northern
                        India. Forming part of the larger Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent, the state is
                        bordered by the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh to the north and northeast, Haryana to the
                        south and southeast, and Rajasthan to the southwest, by the Indian union territories of
                        Chandigarh to the east and Jammu and Kashmir to the north. It is bordered by Punjab, a province
                        of Pakistan to the west. The state covers an area of 50,362 square kilometres (19,445 square
                        miles), 1.53% of India's total geographical area. It is the 20th-largest Indian state by
                        area. With over 27 million inhabitants, Punjab is the 16th-largest state by population,
                        comprising 23 districts.Punjabi, written in the Gurmukhi script, is the most widely spoken
                        and official language of the state. The main ethnic group are the Punjabis, with Sikhs and
                        Hindus as the dominant religious groups. The state capital is Chandigarh, a union territory
                        and also the capital of the neighbouring state of Haryana. The five tributary rivers of the
                        Indus River from which the region took its name are the Sutlej, Ravi, Beas, Chenab and Jhelum
                        rivers; the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas rivers flow through the Indian Punjab.</p>

                    <p>The culture of Punjab encompasses the spoken languages , written literature, cuisine, science,
                        technology, military warfare, architecture, traditions, sacrifices, values and history of the
                        Punjabi people native to the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The term 'Punjabi' can
                        mean both a person who lives in Punjab and also a speaker of the Punjabi language. This name
                        originates from the Persian language 'panj', (five), and 'ab', (water). In Rigvedic times, this
                        area was called Sapta Sindhu or 'Seven Rivers' illustrating the extent of Undivided Punjab.
                        Indus River (the largest river in this five river system), and the five other rivers to the
                        south eventually join Indus or merge into it later in the downstream of the Punjab valley. All
                        the rivers start and flow out of the Himalayas. These other five rivers are Jhelum River, Chenab
                        River, Ravi River, Beas River and Sutlej River.

                    <p>Punjab means ‘the land of Five Waters’ referring to the rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and
                        Beas.
                        Much of the Frontier was occupied by Maharaja Ranjit Singh also known as Sher-e-Punjab in the
                        early 19th century and then taken over by the East India Company when it annexed Punjab in 1849.
                        The state is divided into three parts- Majha, Doaba and Malwa.
                        It’s many festivals–Teej, Lohri, Basant Panchami, Baisakhi and Hola Mahalla to name some are
                        celebrations that mirror the farming ethos.
                        Historically, Punjab has played host to a number of ethnicities, including the Aryans, Persians,
                        Greeks, Afghans and Mongols, thus bestowed with a rich tangible heritage.
                        The southeastern city of Punjab, Patiala was once a princely state established under Baba Ala
                        Singh, a Jat Sikh chieftain. He laid the foundation of the fort and now, is located in the
                        region around Qila Mubarak or the Fortunate Castle.
                        Important tourist attractions are Kali Temple, Baradari Garden, Sheesh Mahal, Gurudwara Dukh
                        Niwaran Sahib, Qila Mubarak complex etc.</p>

                        and many more. There are numerous anniversary celebrations as well in honour of the Gurus (the
