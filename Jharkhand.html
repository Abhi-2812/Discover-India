                        the Land of Forests, Jharkhand is enshrouded in the hills and forests inaccessible to a large
                        segment of people

                    <p>he communities of Jharkhand have a rich culture and tradition with several colorful festivals.
                        Branches of scared trees are brought and ceremonially planted in the courtyards. Devotees then
                        worship these tree parts associated with gods and goddesses. Karma puja, Jitis puja, Sarhul are
                        a few of these examples.

                        Poush Mela or Tusu Fair is a significant occasion celebrated during the Makar Sankranti wherein
                        brightly colored and decorated artifacts of folk deity are carried by the people. This is a folk
                        harvesting festival. Tusu is a folk belief, not about any God or Goddess, but about a sweet
                        little girl of the tribal folk. The festival takes place as new crops are harvested.

                    <p>The region have been inhabited since the Stone Age. Copper tools from the Chalcolithic period
                        have been discovered.[ This area entered the Iron Age during the mid-2nd millennium BCE.[3][4]

                        The region came under the control of the Maurya Empire and much later (17th century) was later
                        conquered by the Mughal emperors Akbar. With the Mughal decline, the region came under local
                        rulers from the Chero caste and others, before its subjugation by the British East India Company
                        in the late 18th century, succeeded by the British Raj from the mid-19th century, both
                        encountering much local resistance. At this time the territory was covered by nine princely
                        states. Under the Raj, till 1905, the region fell within the Bengal Presidency, most of it then
                        being transferred to the Central Provinces and Orissa Tributary States; then in 1936 the whole
                        region was assigned to the Eastern States Agency.</p>
