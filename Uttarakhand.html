                    <p>Uttarakhand is a state in the northern part of India. It is often referred to as the
                        "Devbhumi" (literally "Land of the Gods") due to its religious significance and numerous
                        Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres found throughout the state. Uttarakhand is known for the
                        natural environment of the Himalayas, the Bhabar and the Terai regions. It borders the Tibet
                        Autonomous Region of China to the north; the Sudurpashchim Province of Nepal to the east; the
                        Indian states of Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh to the west and north-west. The
                        state is divided into two divisions, Garhwal and Kumaon, with a total of 13 districts. The
                        winter capital of Uttarakhand is Dehradun, the largest city of the state, which is a rail head.
                        Bhararisain, a town in Chamoli district, is the summer capital of Uttarakhand.[28][29][30] The
                        High Court of the state is located in Nainital.</p>

                    <p>In the Puranas, Uttarakhand was the ancient term for the central Indian Himalayas. ... Its peaks
                        and valleys were known as Svarga loka: a temporary abode of the righteous, and the source of the
                        Ganges. At that time, present-day Uttarakhand was also reportedly inhabited by rishis and
                        sadhus.</p>
