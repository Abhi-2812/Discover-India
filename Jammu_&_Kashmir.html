                    <p>Jammu and Kashmir, union territory of India (until October 31, 2019, a state), located in the
                        northern part of the Indian subcontinent centred on the plains around Jammu to the south and the
                        Vale of Kashmir to the north. The union territory is part of the larger region of Kashmir, which
                        has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since the partition of the
                        subcontinent in 1947. Legislation passed in August 2019 set the stage for downgrading Jammu and
                        Kashmir from statehood to union territory status and splitting off a part of it, known as the
                        Ladakh region, into a separate union territory. The change went into effect on October 31 of
                        that year, though several court cases affecting its status remained pending in the years that
                        followed.
                        Jammu and Kashmir, formerly one of the largest princely states of India, is bounded to the east
                        by the Indian union territory of Ladakh, to the south by the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh
                        and Punjab, to the southwest by Pakistan, and to the northwest by the Pakistani-administered
                        portion of Kashmir. The administrative capitals are Srinagar in summer and Jammu in winter. Area
                        16,309 square miles (101,387 square km). Pop. (2011) 12,367,013.</p>

                    <p>Jammu Kashmir is a diverse blend of various cultures People from different religious and social
                        practices of Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist have created a composite culture of the state
                        which is called Kashmiriyat. Kashmiri comprises of Kashmiri Pundits, Kashmiri Muslims, Gurjars,
                        and Rajasthani Rajputs.

                        Kashmiri Weddings traditions are full of joyful and traditional ceremonies. Emphasis is also
                        laid into matching the background, status, and reputation of the family of the prospective
                        match.
                        Due to Kashmir’s close proximity to Central Asia, Eastern Asia, and Southern Asia, a unique
                        blend of music has evolved encompassing the music of the three regions.

                        But, overall, Kashmiri Valley music is closer to Central Asian music, using traditional Central
                        Asian instruments and musical scales, while music from Jammu is similar to that of North India.

                        The Dumhal is a famous dance in the Kashmir valley, performed by men of the Wattal region. The
                        women perform the Rouff, another traditional folk dance./p>

                    <p>ammu and Kashmir has the distinction of having multifaceted, variegated and unique cultural
                        blend, making it distinct from the rest of the country, not only from the different cultural
                        forms and heritage, but from geographical, demographically, ethical, social entities, forming a
                        distinct spectrum of diversity and diversions into Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh, all professing
                        diverse religion, language and culture, but continuously intermingling, making it vibrant
                        specimens of Indian Unity amidst diversity. Its different cultural forms like art and
                        architecture, fair and festivals, rites and rituals, seer and sagas, language and mountains,
                        embedded in ageless period of history, speak volumes of unity and diversity with unparalleled
                        cultural cohesion and cultural service.
                        Like the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, Srinagar too has a distinctive blend of cultural heritage.
                        Holy places in and around the city depict the historical cultural and religious diversity of the
                        city as well as the Kashmir valley.While the Kashmir has been the highest learning centre of
                        Sanskrit and Persian where early Indo-Aryanic civilization has originated and flourshed, it has
                        also been embracing point of advent of Islam bringing its fold finest traditions of Persian
                        civilization, tolerance, brotherhood and sacrifice.</p>

                    <p>It is important to note that Kashmiri culture is predominantly followed only in the Kashmir
                        valley and Doda of the Chenab region. Jammu and Ladakh have their own distinct cultures that are
                        very different from that of Kashmir.

                        The Dumhal is a famous dance in the Kashmir valley, performed by men of the Wattal region. The
                        women perform the Roaff, another traditional folk dance. Kashmir has been noted for its fine
                        arts for centuries, including poetry and handicrafts. Shikaras, traditional small wooden boats,
                        and houseboatsare a common feature in various lakes and rivers across the Valley. Kashmiri
                        culture is defined in terms of religious values, Kashmiri language, literature, cuisine and
                        traditional values of mutual respect. The overwhelming majority of Kashmiris are Muslims and
                        Islamic identity plays a very important role in the daily lives of people. Kashmiris across the
                        religious divide have for centuries shared cordial and friendly ties. Kashmiri poets and writers
                        like Mehjoor, Abdul Ahad Azad, etc. enriched the literature with their poetry. Kashmiri cuisine
                        holds a unique place among different world cuisines. Salted tea or Noon Chai also called Sheer
                        Chai is the traditional drink and is cooked in a Samavar, a Kashmiri tea-pot. Kashmir has been
                        noted for its fine arts for centuries, including poetry and handicrafts. </p>

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>The history of Kashmir started just before the great Mahabharat war. The first ruler of Kashmir
                        was Gonanda, Gonanda was killed in a battle along with his son and at the time of the
                        commencement of the Mahabharat war, Gonanda II was ruling over Kashmir. Ashoka founded the old
                        city of Srinagar known now as “Pandrethan”. After the death of Ashoka, his son Jaluka ascended
                        the throne of Kashmir, and the latter was succeeded by his son King Damodar II.
                        Then Kashmir was ruled by Muslims and Mughal respectively. The Mughal rulers never came alone
                        but were always accompanied by hundreds of Nobles, Amirs and Umrah, Princes, and Army Generals.
                        Then came the Afghan Rule and the Dogra Period, The greatest service of the first Dogra ruler is
                        the foundation that he laid for the modern Jammu and Kashmir State.
                        When India got freedom in 1947 Hari Singh the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, wanted his state to
                        remain independent, and have two options either to include their state in India or in Pakistan,
                        Hari Singh took a long time to make this decision. At the same time, Kashmiri (Muslim majority
                        population) on the Pakistan side opened a front against Hari Singh. To deal with the rebellion,
                        Hari Singh sought the help of the Indian Army and agreed to merge his kingdom in India.

                        The land was divided into two parts- India and Pakistan. The Indian side of Kashmir is called
                        Jammu and Kashmir and the Pakistani-controlled part of the region is called Azad Kashmir. </p>
