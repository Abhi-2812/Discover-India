                    <p>Maharashtra, state of India, occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan plateau in the western
                        peninsular part of the subcontinent. Its shape roughly resembles a triangle, with the 450-mile
                        (725-km) western coastline forming the base and its interior narrowing to a blunt apex some 500
                        miles (800 km) to the east. Maharashtra is bounded by the Indian states of Gujarat to the
                        northwest, Madhya Pradesh to the north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the southeast,
                        Karnataka to the south, and Goa to the southwest and by the union territory of Dadra and Nagar
                        Haveli and the Arabian Sea to the west.

                        Maharashtra’s capital, Mumbai (formerly Bombay), is an island city on the western coast,
                        connected to the mainland by roads and railways. Aptly called the gateway of India, Maharashtra
                        is one of India’s biggest commercial and industrial centres, and it has played a significant
                        role in the country’s social and political life.Maharashtra is a leader among Indian states in
                        terms of agricultural and industrial production, trade and transport, and education. Its ancient
                        culture, at one stage considerably obscured by British dominance, survives largely through the
                        medium of a strong literary heritage. A common literature in Marathi, the predominant language
                        of the state, has in fact played an important role in nurturing a sense of unity among the
                        Maharashtrians. Area 118,800 square miles (307,690 square km).

                    <p>Maharashtra is the third largest state of India. It has a long history of Marathi saints of
                        Varakari religious movement, such as Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Chokhamela, Eknath and Tukaram which
                        forms the one of bases of the culture of Maharashtra or Marathi culture.[1] Maharashtra had huge
                        influence over India under the 17th-century king Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj of the Maratha
                        Empire and his concept of Hindavi Swarajya which translates to self-rule of people.[2] The state
                        of Maharashtra spans multiple cultures which includes cultures related to Hindus, Muslims,
                        Buddhists, Sikhs, Christians, etc. Lord Ganesha, Maruti, Mahadeo in form of Shivlinga, Khandoba
                        , Kalubai devi, and Lord Vitthal are some of the deities worshipped by Hindus of Maharashtra.
                        Maharashtra is divided into various regions, such as Marathwada, Vidarbha, Khandesh, and Konkan.
                        Each has its own cultural identity in the form of different dialects of Marathi language,[3]
                        folk songs, food,dress and ethnicity.</p>

                    <p>Maharashtra is one of India's largest commercial and industrial centres, which has led to its
                        being called the gateway of India. Maharashtra is also famous for its culture and beauty. The
                        ancient cave paintings found at Ajanta and Ellora are UNESCO World Heritage sites and popular
                        tourist destinations.Maharashtra's rich heritage is reflected in its 5 UNESCO world heritage
                        sites of Ellora caves in
                        Aurangabad district which is a complex of massive rock-cut architecture. There are 34
                        monasteries and temples. Kailasa temple is located in this complex. Ajanta caves in Aurangabad
                        district is home to 29 caves.</p>

                    <p>The folk music and dances of Maharashtra are Koli, Powada, Banjara Holi dance and Lavani dance.
                        Powada dance form shows achievements of Shivaji Maharaja, the Maratha ruler. Koli music and
                        dance originated from the fishermen community for entertainment. Lavani dance form showcases
                        many topics like romance, politics, tragedy, society, etc. 'Lavani' comes from the "Lavanya"
                        meaning 'beautiful' or 'beauty'.
                        There are around 80 per cent of Hindus and a significant amount of Muslims in Maharastra.
                        Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and other religions are a minority. Churches, temples,
                        mosques and other religious centres are found throughout Maharashtra. The people of Maharashtra
                        take pride in their cultural diversity and respect every religion.</p>

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>The name Maharashtra, denoting the western upland of the Deccan plateau, first appeared in a
                        7th-century inscription and in the account of Xuanzang, a Chinese traveler at that time.
                        According to one interpretation, the name derives from the word maharathi (great chariot
                        driver), which refers to a skillful northern fighting force that migrated southward into the
                        area.By the mid-16th century, Maharashtra was again fragmented between several independent
                        Muslim rulers, who fought each other endlessly. It was in the midst of that chaos that a great
                        leader, Shivaji, was born in 1627. Shivaji showed astonishing prowess by founding a large
                        Maratha empire that shook Delhi-based Mughal rule to its foundations.
                        During the 18th century almost all of western and central India, as well as large segments of
                        the north and east, was brought under the suzerainty of the Maratha confederacy, an alliance
                        formed after Shivaji’s kingdom had collapsed. Europeans, however, had been present along the
                        coast since the early 16th century. Britain gained control of Bombay Island in 1661, and from
                        the early 19th century onward the Marathas gradually succumbed to British expansion on the
                        mainland. The British proceeded to establish an administrative province known as the Bombay
                        Presidency. After India gained its independence in 1947, the province became Bombay state
                        (1950). A number of former princely states (notably Baroda [now Vadodara]) subsequently were
                        merged into the new state.
                        The present state of Maharashtra came into being on 1 May 1960 as a Marathi speaking state.
