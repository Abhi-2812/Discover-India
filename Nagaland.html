                    <p>Nagaland is a state in northeastern India. It is bordered by the state of
                        Arunachal Pradesh to the north, Assam to the west, Manipur to the south and the Sagaing Region
                        of Myanmar to the east. Its capital city is Kohima and its largest city is Dimapur. It has an
                        area of 16,579 square kilometres (6,401 sq mi) with a population of 1,980,602 per the 2011
                        Census of India, making it one of India's smallest states.

                        Nagaland became the 16th state of India on 1 December 1963. It has experienced insurgency and
                        inter-ethnic conflict since the 1950s, limiting its economic development.[8][9]

                        Agriculture is its most important economic activity, accounting for over 70% of its economy.
                        Other significant activities include forestry, tourism, insurance, real estate, and
                        miscellaneous cottage industries.

                        It lies between the parallels of 98 and 96 degrees east longitude and 26.6 and 27.4 degrees
                        latitude north. It is home to a rich variety of flora and fauna.</p>

                    <p>Nagaland is known for its exquisite bamboo and cane products, weaving and wood carving. The most
                        important works of art and crafts exist in the form of Basketry, Weaving, Woodcarving, Pottery,
                        Metal work, Jewellery and Beadwork. Dance and music are essential parts of Nagaland's culture

                    <p>Most of these festivals revolve round agriculture, it being the main-stay of Naga society. Over
                        85% population of Nagaland is directly dependent on agriculture and lives in a thousand and odd
                        villages situated on high hill tops or slopes overlooking verdant valleys humming with murmuring
                        streams. In this blissful setting Nagas enjoy the blessing of Nature with rare gusto striking
                        the onlookers with awe and admiration. In most of the places agriculture consists of monocrop.

                        Although some religious and spiritual sentiments are inter woven into secular rites and rituals,
                        the pre- dominant theme of the festivals is offering of prayers to a Supreme Being having
                        different names in different Naga dialects. At these festivals, the spirit of Gods is
                        propitiated with sacrifices by the Village Shaman for a bountiful harvest either before the
                        sowing or on the eve of harvest.

                        The State is replete with festivities throughout the year, as all tribes celebrate their own
                        festivals with a pageantry of colour, music and dance. A common feature is that the festivals
                        revolve around agriculture, the mainstay of Naga economy. These festivals hark back to times
                        prior to the advent of Christianity.</p>

                    <p>The traditional Naga religion is often called —animism“. Animism is the belief in the existence
                        of spiritual beings inhabiting the natural world. Traditional Naga religion is however somewhat
                        different from other forms of religion called —animistic“ in that they also believe in gods.

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>Nagaland has no early written history, although medieval chronicles of the neighbouring Ahom
                        kingdom of Assam tell of the Naga tribes, their economy, and their customs. The 1816 invasion of
                        Assam by Burmans from Myanmar led to oppressive Burman rule from 1819 until the establishment of
                        British rule over Assam in 1826</p>
