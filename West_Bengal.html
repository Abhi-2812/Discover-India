                    <p>West Bengal is
                        a state in the eastern region of India along the Bay of Bengal. With over 91 million
                        inhabitants, it is the fourth-most populous state and the fourteenth-largest state by area in
                        India. Covering an area of 88,752 km2 (34,267 sq mi), it is also the eighth-most populous
                        country subdivision of the world. Part of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, it
                        borders Bangladesh in the east, and Nepal and Bhutan in the north. It also borders the Indian
                        states of Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata, the
                        third-largest metropolis, and seventh largest city by population in India. West Bengal includes
                        the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, the Ganges delta, the Rarh region and the coastal
                        Sundarbans. The state's main ethnic group are the Bengalis, with the Bengali Hindus forming the
                        demographic majority.</p>

                    <p>The culture of West Bengal is an Indian culture which has its roots in the Bengali literature,
                        music, fine arts, drama and cinema. Different geographic regions of West Bengal have subtle as
                        well as more pronounced variations between each other, with Darjeeling Himalayan hill region and
                        Duars showing particularly different socio-cultural aspects.

                    <p>The historic and cultural gem called Malda should be at the top of your travel itinerary. Nestled
                        on the confluence of Mahananda and Kalindi rivers, the ancient town is a popular tourist
                        destination in West Bengal and boasts several ancient monuments and buildings that stand as a
                        testimony to its rich culture and history. Some of the must-visit places here include the “Jami
                        Masjid Mosque”, built in the 16th century AD, “Neema Sari Tower” and “Malda Museum”, which
                        houses 1500 years old anthropological samples, calligraphic inscriptions, ancient sculptures and
                        terracotta artefacts, and other precious items.

                        About 12 km south of Malda lies the town of Gaur, which once served as the capital of three
                        significant dynasties of ancient Bengal – Buddhist Palas, Muslim Nawabs and the Hindu Senas. The
                        most important historical centre of the region, it is today home to numerous ancient monuments
                        and ruins that fascinate historians, architecture buffs and culture enthusiasts. One must also
                        visit the “Dakhil Darwaza”, “Firoz Minar” and “Qadam-e-Rasool Mosque”, all of which are the
                        town’s popular tourist attractions.

                    <p>The Baul tradition is a unique heritage of Bengali folk music, which has also been influenced by
                        regional music traditions. Other folk music forms include Kabigaan, Gombhira, Bhawaiya, kirtans,
                        and Gajan festival music. Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the ektara, a
                        one-stringed instrument.
