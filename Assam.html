                    <p>Assam is a state in
                        northeastern India, south of the eastern Himalayas along the Brahmaputra and Barak River
                        valleys. Assam covers an area of 78,438 km2 (30,285 sq mi). The state is bordered by Bhutan and
                        Arunachal Pradesh to the north; Nagaland and Manipur to the east; Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram
                        and Bangladesh to the south; and West Bengal to the west via the Siliguri Corridor, a 22
                        kilometres (14 mi) wide strip of land that connects the state to the rest of India. Assamese is
                        the official and most commonly spoken language of the state, followed by Bengali, which is
                        official in the Barak Valley and Bodo, which is co-official in Assam and official in Bodoland
                        Territorial Region.

                        Assam is known for Assam tea and Assam silk. The state was the first site for oil drilling in
                        Asia. Assam is home to the one-horned Indian rhinoceros, along with the wild water buffalo,
                        pygmy hog, tiger and various species of Asiatic birds, and provides one of the last wild
                        habitats for the Asian elephant. The Assamese economy is aided by wildlife tourism to Kaziranga
                        National Park and Manas National Park, which are World Heritage Sites. Dibru-Saikhowa National
                        Park is famed for its feral horses. Sal tree forests are found in the state which, as a result
                        of abundant rainfall, look green all year round. Assam receives more rainfall than most parts of
                        India; this rain feeds the Brahmaputra River, whose tributaries and oxbow lakes provide the
                        region with a hydro-geomorphic environment.</p>

                    <p>Assam is the meeting ground of diverse cultures. The people of the enchanting state of Assam is
                        an intermixture of various racial stocks such as Mongoloid, Indo-Burmese, Indo-Iranian and
                        Aryan. The Assamese culture is a rich and exotic tapestry of all these races evolved through a
                        long assimilative process. The natives of the state of Assam are known as "Asomiya" (Assamese),
                        which is also the state language of Assam.

                        The state has a large number of tribes, each unique in its tradition, culture, dress and exotic
                        way of life. Diverse tribes like Bodo, Kachari, Karbi, Miri, Mishimi, Rabha, etc co-exist in
                        Assam, most tribes have their own languages though Assamese is the principal language of the
                        state.Weaving is one traditional craft that every Assamese woman takes pride in. The Assamese
                        women produce silk and cotton clothes of exquisite designs in their looms. Assam is renowned for
                        its exquisite silks namely Eri, Pat and the world famous Muga silk. Gandhiji complimented the
                        Assamese weavers as artists who could weave dreams in their looms.

                        The Gamocha is one of the most easily recognizable cultural symbols of the Assamese people
                        besides the tamol-paan (areca nut & betel leaf) which is an integral part of almost all
                        socio-religious ceremonies. </p>

                    <p>Assam has wildlife sanctuaries, the most prominent of which are two UNESCO World Heritage
                        sites[62]-the Kaziranga National Park, on the bank of the Brahmaputra River, and the Manas
                        Wildlife Sanctuary, near the border with Bhutan. The Kaziranga is a refuge for the
                        fast-disappearing Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The state is the last refuge for numerous other
                        endangered and threatened species including the white-winged wood duck or deohanh, Bengal
                        florican, black-breasted parrotbill, red-headed vulture, white-rumped vulture, greater adjutant,
                        Jerdon's babbler, rufous-necked hornbill, Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, pygmy hog, gaur, wild
                        water buffalo, Indian hog deer, hoolock gibbon, golden langur, capped langur, barasingha, Ganges
                        river dolphin, Barca snakehead, Ganges shark, Burmese python, brahminy river turtle, black pond
                        turtle, Asian forest tortoise, and Assam roofed turtle. Threatened species that are extinct in
                        Assam include the gharial, a critically endangered fish-eating crocodilian, and the pink-headed
                        duck (which may be extinct worldwide). For the state bird, the white-winged wood duck, Assam is
                        a globally important area.[clarification needed][63] In addition to the above, there are three
                        other National Parks in Assam namely Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Nameri National Park and the
                        Orang National Park.</p>

                    <div class="title">Tradition</div>
                    <p>Assam has a rich tradition of performing arts and folk music. One of the most fascinating dance
                        forms is the Ankiya Nat which is a traditional Vaishnav dance-drama dating back to the 15th
                        century. It is a very vivid dance which makes use of large masks of gods, goddesses, demons and
                        animals. The Bihu dance performed during the Bohag Bihu, Bagurumba and Bordoicikhla dance of
                        Bodos, Mishing, and the Banjar Kekan performed by Karbis are some of the major folk dances. The
                        musical tradition of the land is equally rich. Folk songs and music related to Bihu and other
                        festivals dates back to time-immemorial. The musicians use a large numbers of traditional
                        musical instruments including several types of drums, string instruments, flutes, cymbals,
                        pipes, etc.
                        Assam is also steeped in a tradition of crafts with master artisans practicing cane and bamboo
                        work, bell metal and brass smithy, silk and cotton weaving, toy and mask making, pottery and
                        terracotta work, and wood craft. Cane and bamboo craft provide the most commonly used utilities
                        in daily life, ranging from household utilities, weaving accessories, fishing accessories,
                        furniture, musical instruments to construction materials. Assam is the home of several types of
                        silks, the most prestigious being Muga – the natural golden silk, Pat – a creamy-bright-silver
                        coloured silk, and Eri – a variety used for manufacturing warm clothes for winter.</p>

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>The history of Assam has passed several stages of development to reach to its present state. The
                        history of Assam can be divided into four eras. The ancient era began in the 4th century with
                        the mention of Kamarupa in Samudragupta's inscriptions on the Allahabad pillar and the
                        establishment of the Kamarupa kingdom. The medieval era began with the attacks from the Bengal
                        Sultanate, the first of which took place in 1206 by Bakhtiyar Khilji as mentioned in the
                        Kanai-boroxiboa rock inscription, after the breakup of the ancient kingdom and the sprouting of
                        medieval kingdoms and chieftain-ships in its place. The colonial era began with the
                        establishment of British control after the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826, and the post-colonial era
                        began in 1947 after the Independence of India.
                        The Assam Movement (1979-1985) was a popular movement against illegal immigrants in Assam. The
                        movement, led by All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad
                        (AAGSP), developed a program of protests and demonstration to compel the Indian government to
                        identify and expel illegal, (mostly Bangladeshisi), immigrants and protect and provide
                        constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to the indigenous Assamese people. The
                        agitation programs were largely non-violent, but the Nellie massacre was a case of extreme
                        violence. The agitation program ended in August 1985 following the Assam Accord, which was
                        signed by leaders of AASU-AAGSP and the Government of India.

                        The Assam Accord (1985) was a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) signed between representatives of
                        the Government of India and the leaders of the Assam Movement in New Delhi on 15 August 1985. A
                        six-year agitation demanding identification and deportation of illegal immigrants was launched
                        by the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) in 1979. It culminated with the signing of the Assam
                        Accord.

                        Today Assam has an area of 78,438 square kilometers. It consists of thirty three districts and
                        is credited to be the most populous state in the entire Northeast India.</p>
