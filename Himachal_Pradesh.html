                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>Himachal Pradesh has been inhabited by human beings since the dawn of civilization. It has a rich
                        and varied history which can be divided into several distinct eras. Himachal Pradesh region was
                        called ‘Deva Bhoomi’. In the early period, tribes like the Koilis, Halis, Dagis, Dhaugris, Dasa,
                        Khasas, Kinnars, and Kirats inhabited it.
                        n the early 19th century the British exercised their influence and annexed the areas of Shimla
                        after the Gurkha War of 1815-16. The British gradually emerged as the paramount power in the
                        region. During the first Indian war of independence, rulers of hilly states remain inactive. The
                        rulers of Chamba, Bilaspur, Bhagal, and Dhami, rendered help to the British government during
                        the revolt. During World War I, virtually all rulers of the hill states remained loyal and
                        contributed to the British war effort, both in the form of men and materials.
                        The Chief Commissioner’s province of H.P. came into being on 15th April 1948. This Pradesh
                        became a part C state on 26th January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India.
                        Bilaspur was merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1st July 1954. Himachal Pradesh became Union
                        Territory on 1st November 1956. Kangra and most of the other hill areas of Punjab were merged
                        with Himachal Pradesh on 1st November 1966 though its status remained that of a Union Territory.
                        On 18th December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new
                        state came into being on 25th January 1971.

                        Thus, Himachal Pradesh emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union. It became a
                        centrally administered territory in 1948 with the integration of 31 hill states and received
                        additional regions added to it in 1966.</p>
