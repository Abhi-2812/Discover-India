                    <p>Tamil Nadu is a state in
                        southern India. Its capital and largest city is Chennai. The state is the home of the Tamil
                        people, whose Tamil language—one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world—is
                        widely spoken in the state and serves as its official language.

                        Lying in the southern-most part of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is bordered by the Indian
                        union territory of Puducherry and the states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, as well
                        as an international maritime border with Sri Lanka. The state is bounded by the Western Ghats in
                        the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and
                        Palk Strait to the south-east, and the Indian Ocean in the south. Tamil Nadu is the tenth
                        largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by population.</p>

                    <p>Although four-fifths of the population of the state are Hindus, rest of them are divided in
                        Islam, Christianity, and Jainism. Their rituals include deity worship and animisms like tree
                        worship, animal worship and stars and planets worship.

                    <p>Hinduism lies at the core of the culture of Tamil Nadu. Among the most famous of the state's
                        temples, which number in the tens of thousands, are the 7th- and 8th-century structures at
                        Mamallapura, which were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984.</p>

                    <p>Paintings. Tanjore paintings of Tamil Nadu are a stamp of the rich cultural heritage of India.
                        Done up in effervescent shades and studded with vibrant pearls, semi-precious stones, glass
                        pieces and gold, this art work is a masterwork that is done on bases like ivory, wood, or mica.

                    <p>The three ancient Tamil dynasties namely Chera, Chola, and Pandya were of ancient origins. ...
                        After the independence of India, after the Telugu and Malayalam parts of Madras state were
                        separated from Tamilagam state in 1956, it was renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1968 by the state
                        government.</p>
