                    <p>Tripura is a state in northeastern India. The third-smallest state in the
                        country, it covers 10,491.69 km2 (4,050.86 sq mi) and is bordered by Bangladesh to the north,[8]
                        south, and west, and the Indian states of Assam and Mizoram to the east. In 2011 the state had
                        3,671,032 residents, constituting 0.3% of the country's population.

                        The area of modern Tripura — ruled for several centuries by the Manikya dynasty — was part of an
                        independent princely state under the protectorate of the British Empire. The independent Tripuri
                        Kingdom (also known as Hill Tippera) joined the newly independent India in 1949.

                        Tripura lies in a geographically isolated location in India, as only one major highway, National
                        Highway 8, connects it with the rest of the country. Five mountain ranges — Boromura,
                        Atharamura, Longtharai, Shakhan and Jampui Hills — run north to south, with intervening valleys;
                        Agartala, the capital, is located on a plain to the west. The state has a tropical savanna
                        climate, and receives seasonal heavy rains from the south west monsoon. Forests cover more than
                        half of the area, in which bamboo and cane tracts are common. Tripura has the highest number of
                        primate species found in any Indian state. Due to its geographical isolation, economic progress
                        in the state is hindered. Poverty and unemployment continue to plague Tripura, which has a
                        limited infrastructure. Most residents are involved in agriculture and allied activities,
                        although the service sector is the largest contributor to the state's gross domestic product.

                    <p>Tripura has several diverse ethno-linguistic groups, which has given rise to a composite culture.
                        The dominant cultures are Bengali, Manipuri, Tripuris, Jamatia, Reang, Naitong, Koloi, Murasing,
                        Chakma, Halam, Garo, Hajong, Kuki, Mizo, Mogh, Munda, Oraon, Santhal, and Uchoi.

                    <p> process has gained in momentum by the catholicity of culture practised by the kings of Manikya
                        dynasty who ruled the state for more than five centuries and their magnanimous espousal of
                        cultural cross-currents. The inevitable fall-out of this was the domination of Indian film and
                        popular music spanning five decades by maestro Sachin Debbarman, a scion of Tripura’s royal
                        family and the overwhelming appreciation showered on a troupe of Reang tribal girls who
                        enthralled a Japanese audience with delicately rhythmic performance of their traditional
                        ‘Hozagiri' dance in an auditorium of Tokyo.</p>

                    <p>Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Ashokastami and the worship of the Chaturdasha deities are important
                        festivals. Several festivals represent confluence of several tribal traditions, such as Ganga
                        puja, Garia puja, Kherchi puja, Ker puja.

                    <p>On January 26, 1950 Tripura was accorded the status of a 'C' category state and on November 1,
                        1956, it was recognized as a Union Territory. With the sustained efforts and struggle of the
                        people of Tripura, it gained full statehood on January 21, 1972, as per the North-East
                        Reorganisation Act, 1971</p>
