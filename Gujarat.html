                    <p>Gujarat is a state on the
                        western coast of India with a coastline of about 1,600 km (990 mi) – longest in the country,
                        most of which lies on the Kathiawar peninsula – and a population of 60.4 million. It is the
                        fifth-largest Indian state by area and the ninth-largest state by population. Gujarat is
                        bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south,
                        Maharashtra to the southeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani
                        province of Sindh to the west. Its capital city is Gandhinagar, while its largest city is
                        Ahmedabad. The Gujarati people of India are indigenous to the state and their language,
                        Gujarati, is the state's official language. The economy of Gujarat is the fifth-largest in
                        India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹16.30 trillion (US$220 billion) and has
                        the country's 10th-highest GSDP per capita of ₹213,936 (US$2,800).[1] Gujarat ranks 21st among
                        Indian states in human development index.</p>

                    <div class="title">Culture</div>
                    <p>Gujarat is a flourishing state with cultural diversity. It is vibrant with its true colors of
                        rich heritage and cultural traditions. Dating back to history with the Harappan civilization,
                        the state becomes a confluence of many religions – Hinduism, Islam, Jainism and Buddhism. The
                        Gujarati culture blends in arts, beliefs, customs, traditions, institutions, inventions,
                        language, technology and values.

                        Gujarat is influenced with enculturation; a culture shared with members of the society and
                        passed on from one generation to the next. Enculturation has unified people with common sense
                        experience and influence that lead to knowledge and appreciation of cultural traditions and
                        lifestyles. The aspect of joining hands to greet or bow down comes through age influences as
                        offering reverence.

                        Social systems of learning, religious practices and forms of artistic expressions have led way
                        to more balanced lifestyles in Gujarat. People of Gujarat are found to be sharing cultural
                        traits and patterns with other regions and also extend beyond national boundaries towards
                        International culture.

                        As Gujarat stands as ‘Heart of India’, Multiculturalism is traced in Gujarat. Shared cultural
                        background making people feel to home ground and more comfortable with other people from their
                        own culture. Culture shock unlike other countries is therefore, a missing point which makes
                        people more confident and energetic as they stand for a challenge in global scenario.

                        Festivals and fairs, arts and crafts, folk dances, music, cuisine and lifestyles form a major
                        cultural background of the people who belong to Gujarat. The customs and beliefs make the
                        culture more homely and truly blended with values and moral characteristics.</p>

                    <div class="title">Heritage</div>
                    <p>Terms like history, heritages and monuments are synonymous to Gujarat. The glorious Gujarat is
                        home to many ancient city ruins, palaces, forts and tomb, which stands proudly bearing testimony
                        to the golden era of dynasties. Since its inception, landscapes of Gujarat are ruled by rulers
                        of many dynasties, invaders and sellers. Gujarat's past is a part of its current terrains,
                        evidenced by the ancient and historical ruins scattered across the country.

                        Gujarat is rich in history: must see places in the state covers impressive colonial
                        architecture, numerous UNESCO world heritage sites and the ancient temples. In Gujarat, one can
                        see the massive forts, charmings havelis, stunning steepwells and many other historical sites
                        that showcase some of the relics of the land. The state is indeed a paradise for all the history
                        lovers as it's is blessed with jaw-dropping feats accomplished by ancient civilisations.

                        Go for a tour to Gujarat, wander among ancient ruins and immerse yourself in its unique history
                        and spiritual heritage. Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Junagadh are the indisputable top three
                        destinations, but in all fairness, Gujarat beyond the mega-attractions has so much to offer the
                        curious traveller.</p>

                    <div class="title">Tradition</div>
                    <p>The traditional folk dance forms include Garba, Dandiya Raas, Tippani, Padhar, Sidi, and Dangi.

                        Dandiya Raas
                        Dandiya Raas is a romantic, very energetic, colourful, and playful dance originating in the
                        state of Gujarat. Its roots lay from the days of Lord Krishna, who played raas on the shores of
                        Yamuna river on a moonlit night with his beloved Gopis.

                        Men and women dressed in colorful clothes dance in two concentric circles - one moving
                        clockwise, one moving counter-clockwise. Men and women carry two bamboo sticks called dandiyas
                        in their hands. In addition to footwork, one of the most enjoyable parts of this dance is the
                        creative use of dandiyas.

                        The song sung on occasion is essentially an amorous one. Raas is a very playful dance providing
                        the opportunity for acting and exchanging messages through eye contact. It is no wonder that
                        many romances bloom during Navratri and hence the popularity of the dance among the younger
                        generation.Garba is a very graceful form of dance mainly performed by females in a circular
                        formation. It is in reverences of goddess Ambaji. The basics of the dance are singing and
                        clapping rhythmically while going around the goddess. Today many modifications are prevalent to
                        the basic pattern, and even men are free to join in. Women are dressed in exquisitely
                        embroidered, set in mirrors cholis, ghaghras, and bandhani dupattas! Extensive jewelry in the
                        form of necklaces, bracelets and anklets are also worn. The typical dress code of men is
                        kehediyu, chudidar, and a turban.

                    <div class="title">History</div>
                    <p>The history of Gujarat began with Stone Age settlements followed by Chalcolithic and Bronze Age
                        settlements like Indus Valley Civilisation.[1] Gujarat's coastal cities, chiefly Bharuch, served
                        as ports and trading centers in the Nanda, Maurya, Satavahana and Gupta empires as well as
                        Western Kshatrapas period. After the fall of the Gupta empire in the 6th century, Gujarat
                        flourished as an independent Jainism/Hindu/Buddhist state.
                        Later in the 18th century, Gujarat came under control of the Maratha Empire who dominated the
                        politics of India. The British East India Company wrested control of much of Gujarat from the
                        Marathas during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. Many local rulers, notably the Gaekwads of Baroda,
                        made a separate peace with the British and acknowledged British sovereignty in return for
                        retaining local self-rule. Gujarat was placed under the political authority of the Bombay
                        Presidency, with the exception of Baroda state, which had a direct relationship with the
                        Governor-General of India. From 1818 to 1947, most of present-day Gujarat, including Kathiawar,
                        Kutch, and northern and eastern Gujarat were divided into hundreds of princely states, but
                        several districts in central and southern Gujarat were ruled directly by British officials.
                        Mahatma Gandhi, considered India's "father of the nation", was a Gujarati who led the Indian
                        Independence Movement against the British colonial rule.[4]

                        Gujarat was formed by splitting Bombay state in 1960 on linguistic lines. From 1960 to 1995,
                        Indian National Congress retained power in Gujarat Legislative Assembly while other political
                        parties ruled for incomplete terms in the 1970s and 1990. Bharatiya Janata Party has been in the
                        power since 1998.</p>
