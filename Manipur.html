          <p>Manipur is a state in Northeast India, with the city of Imphal as its capital.
            It is bounded by the Indian states of Nagaland to the north, Mizoram to the south and Assam to the west. It
            also borders two regions of Myanmar, Sagaing Region to the east and Chin State to the south. The state
            covers an area of 22,327 square kilometres (8,621 sq mi) and has a population of almost 3 million, including
            the Meitei, who are the majority group in the state, the Meitei Pangals (Manipuri Muslims), Naga tribes,
            Kuki/Zo tribes and other communities, who speak a variety of Sino-Tibetan languages. Manipur has been at the
            crossroads of Asian economic and cultural exchange for more than 2,500 years. It connects the Indian
            subcontinent to South east Asia enabling migration of people, cultures and religions</p>

          <div class="title">Culture</div>
          <p>Manipur is a mosaic of ancient traditions and rich cultural patterns. In the field of art and culture, the
            state is best represented by its classical and folk dance forms. The Raas Leela, the epitome of Manipuri
            classical dance, is inter-woven through the celestial and eternal love of Radha and Krishna as has been
            described in the Hindu scriptures. This graceful dance reveals the sublime and transcendental love of
            Krishna and Radha and the Gopi’s devotion to Lord Krishna. Lai Haraoba, a spring festival celebrated during
            April-May, is symbolised by a traditional and symbolistic dance performed for peace and prosperity. The
            varied and colourful tribal folk dances are an expression of nature, creation, and aestheticism of the
            tribal way of life. The colourful costumes, dance movements, and the unique rituals in the tribal festivals
            like the Lui-Ngai-Ni are simply majestic and charming.</p>

          <div class="title">History</div>
          <p>The earliest recorded history of the Manipur region dates to about 900 CE. The beginning of Manipur’s more
            recent history dates from 1762, when the raja Jai Singh concluded a treaty with the British to repel an
            invasion of Burmans from Myanmar (Burma). Further communication was minimal until 1824, when the British
            were again requested to expel the Burmans. Disputed successions were a continual source of political turmoil
            until Chura Chand, a five-year-old member of the ruling family, was nominated raja in 1891. For the next
            eight years the administration was conducted under British supervision; slavery and forced labour were
            abolished, and roads were constructed.

            In 1907 the government was assumed by the raja and the durbar, or council, whose vice president was a member
            of the Indian civil service. Subsequently, the administration was transferred to the raja, and the vice
            president of the durbar became its president. After an uprising of the Kuki hill tribes in 1917, a new
            system of government was adopted; the region was divided into three subdivisions, each headed by an officer
            from the neighbouring government of Assam.</p>
