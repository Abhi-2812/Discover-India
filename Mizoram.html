                    <p>Mizoram is a state in northeastern India, with
                        Aizawl as its seat of government and capital city. The name of the state is derived from "Mizo",
                        the self described name of the native inhabitants, and "Ram", which in the Mizo language means
                        "land." Thus "Mizo-ram" means "land of the Mizos. Within India's northeast region, it is the
                        southernmost landlocked state, sharing borders with three of the Seven Sister States, namely
                        Tripura, Assam and Manipur. The state also shares a 722-kilometre (449 mi) border with the
                        neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar</p>

                        Meghalaya lies in the extreme northeastern region of India. It is the only state in the entire
                        northeast which is matrilineal and takes the identity solely from the mother. Meghalayan women
                        are very lucky in this way, because they are treated with equal rights but the head of the
                        family is always Father. The occurrence of illegitimate child or child abandoning in this
                        society is rare except for a few stray cases. Off springs whether male or female are treated
                        alike. On the whole, the society is unique, devoid of complexes and the much feared and dreaded
                        bride burning or Dowry system.

                        In this matrilineal society, lets take the Khasis for example, the blood relations on the
                        mother's side are known as the "Cognates" (Ki Kur) and "Agnates" (Ki Kha) refer to the paternal
                        side. The cognates trace their origin from a common ancestress and their lineal descent is from
                        mother to daughter, just the opposite from other societies.</p>

                    <p>Jainsem is the traditional wear of Khasi women. It is a single piece of cloth wrapped in a
                        criss-cross manner across the shoulders and it is paired with a blouse. Dakmanda is a short
                        piece of unstitched cotton cloth worn around the waist by the Garo women. Jaintia women wear
                        blouses paired with sarong which is known as Thoh Khyrwang.

                        The traditional wear of the men includes a headgear or turban and a dhoti which is stitched.

                    <p>Meghalaya, alongside neighbouring Indian states, has been of archaeological interest. People have
                        lived in Meghalaya since the Neolithic. Neolithic sites discovered so far are located in areas
                        of high elevation in Khasi Hills, Garo Hills and in neighbouring states, where Neolithic style
                        jhum or shifting cultivation is practiced even today. The highland plateaus fed by abundant
                        rains provided safety from floods and a rich soil. The importance of Meghalaya is its
                        possible role in human history via domestication of rice. One of the competing theories for the
                        origin of rice comes from Ian Glover, who states, "India is the center of greatest diversity of
                        domesticated rice with over 20,000 identified species and Northeast India is the most favorable
                        single area of the origin of domesticated rice."[20] The limited archaeology done in the hills
                        of Meghalaya suggest human settlement since ancient times.</p>
